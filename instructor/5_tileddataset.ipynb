    "So far all our examples have used the base {obj}`dkist.Dataset` class with VISP data.\n",
    "In this way we have demonstrated the most important features of the Python tools for working with DKIST data, but some data do not quite fit into the base `Dataset` structure.\n",
    "Specifically, VBI data consist of distinct image tiles forming a larger mosaic image.\n",
    "The individual tiles of the image are not combined by the Data Center into a single image, since this would involve interpolation at the tile edges and this is left to the user to make their own choices about.\n",
    "Instead the tiles are kept separate but must therefore be considered as separate images by the `Dataset` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose the Python tools have the {obj}`dkist.TiledDataset` class, which is essentially a 2D array of `Dataset` objects, with some helper functions to make it easier to work with those `Dataset`s either individually or together.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see `TiledDataset` in action we'll load some VBI data. We'll use the VBI data from the sample datasets, which is accessible in the same way as the VISP dataset we used before"
